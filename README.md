# Adjustable-Pacemaker

The Adjustable Pacemaker is a PWM configurable waveform generator that assists those
with irregular, or slow, heartbeats by generating a waveform which will be set according to
the patients needs such as activity level, health condition and lifestyle. The relevant
components of this device are a joystick, which will adjust the frequency which
corresponds to heart rate, 4 push buttons, 3 of which will give the user three different duty
cycle options and the last push button to reset the waveformâ€™s duty cycle and an LCD to
display the specifics of the waveform being generated.
